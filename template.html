                <b>Message from the Director:</b><br> Greetings and a Warm Welcome to IIIT Allahabad!!<br>
                
                Education for an individual aims at enrichment, empowerment and enlightenment, infusing the skills of inquiry in the learner, which in turn illuminates the path of acquiring KNOWLEDGE, translating knowledge into WISDOM that leads to a perpetual journey towards TRUTH. When the humanity collectively tried to fight through a global pandemic, in last few years, an altogether changed World has evolved. In this brave new world, one is increasingly convinced that such empirical threat to the future of humanity can be successfully circumvented only through innovations in Sciences and Engineering, with their rapid translation to sustainable technology, however, within the spheres of humanity, ethics and symbiotic co-existence. Stellar accomplishments expand the frontiers of knowledge and scholarship every day, and that prompts an earnest need to train the next generation of leaders, technocrats and scientists who are not only technically skilled but morally attuned to identifying and solving problems that will take the nation forward.
